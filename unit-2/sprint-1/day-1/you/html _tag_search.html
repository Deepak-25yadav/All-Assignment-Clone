    <h1>b tag: The Bring Attention To element </h1>
    <p>The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise
            granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw
            the
            text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS
                font-weight
                property to create boldface text, or the <strong> element to indicate that text is of special
                    importance.
    </p>

    <h1>i tag: The Idiomatic Text element</h1>
    <p>The <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as
            idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been
            presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.</p>

    <h1>u tag: The Unarticulated Annotation (Underline) element</h1>
    <p>The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it
            has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered
            using CSS.
            <p>Note:Warning: This element used to be called the "Underline" element in older versions of HTML, and is
                still sometimes misused in this way. To underline text, you should instead apply a style that includes
                the CSS text-decoration property set to underline.</p>
    </p>

    

    <h1>button tag:The Button element</h1>
    <p>The HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice
        command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as
        submitting a form or opening a dialog.

        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you
        can change buttons' appearance with CSS.</p>



    <h1>hr tag:The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element</h1>
    <p>The
        HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene
        in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.Try it
        Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a
        horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational
        terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS.
    </p>

    <h1>br tag: The Line Break element</h1>
    <p>The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an
        address, where the division of lines is significant.

        As you can see from the above example, a <br> element is included at each point where we want the text to break.
        The text after the <br> begins again at the start of the next line of the text block.


        Note: Do not use <br> to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in
     elements and use the CSS margin property to control their size.
    
    </p>

    <h1>select tag:The HTML Select element</h1>

    <p> 
        
        The above example shows typical select tag usage. It is given an id attribute to enable it to be associated with a
            label tag for accessibility purposes, as well as a name attribute to represent the name of the associated data
                point submitted to the server. Each menu option is defined by an option tag element nested inside the
                    select tag.

                         Each option tag element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the <br>
                            server when that option is selected. If no value attribute is included, the value defaults <br>
                            to the text contained inside the element. You can include a selected attribute on an <br>
                        option tag  element to make it selected by default when the page first . <br>

                            The select tag element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple <br>
                                to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and size to specify how many <br>
                                options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input <br>
                                attributes such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc. <br>

                                You can further nest option tag elements inside optgroup tag elements to create separate <br>
                                        groups of options inside the. <br> 
                                    
                                    </p>
